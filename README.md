I'm a Artificial Intelligence Scientist in the making at FAST NUCES Islamabad. I work mainly with Python (GeoPandas, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib) but I also aspire to be a full stack developer for which I have started learning new languages and tools to help me along my coding journey.

Techstack: Python | R | C/C++ | Vue | React | Docker | Vagrant | Git | MongoDB | Hadoop | Spark | SQL

I’m currently learning to work with Geospatial data (Python) and MERN Stack
I’m looking to collaborate on more data science + web development related projects
